This Scraper currently only scrapes links out of the public AI Papers You Should Read channel.  


There is no off button for the midi and I am sorry.


In the backend:
-pull URLS
-make JSON  
-make title
-make PDF


The GUI will let you pull links (40-60 second wait)
And Download a PDF with titles (1-2 min wait for download)


HOW TO USE


In main.py REPLACE the ELEMENT(OR OTHER) TOKEN with your new token that will expire in like half a day or whatever. AND the username you use with that.


ACCESS_TOKEN = “blah blah blah” # ← Replace this manually
